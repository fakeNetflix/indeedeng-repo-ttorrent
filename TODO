Code required:

1) Fix piece pipelining. Right now, only blocks pipeline.
2) Handle partially downloaded pieces.
3) Integrate with Yammer Metrics.
4) Share more elegantly in endgame mode.
5) Protocol extension to specify maximum block size - we want 1Mb.

Tests required:

Connect to peers which never offer anything.  Make sure rarestPiece is null.
